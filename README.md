# Quantum Fibonacci Sequenced Transit Data Scheduler (Q.F.S.T.D.S)

**A sovereign computational framework blending Fibonacci recursion, golden ratio geometry, and modern data scheduling.**

---

## ✨ Overview
The **Quantum Fibonacci Sequenced Transit Data Scheduler (Q.F.S.T.D.S)** is a modular Python engine that transforms data transit into a mathematically harmonious process. Inspired by **Leonardo da Vinci’s codexes**, it fuses **Fibonacci pacing**, **golden ratio indexing**, and **spiral geometry mapping** to deliver packets with precision, beauty, and ceremonial resonance.  

Originally released on **December 14, 2025**, Q.F.S.T.D.S is part of the **MK Publishings portfolio** and integrates seamlessly with the **MK Omni Engine** for unified orchestration.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Fibonacci-Paced Scheduling** – Recursive frame pacing for balanced, burst-optimized delivery.  
- **Golden Ratio Indexing** – Quasi-random tile selection for efficient routing and rendering.  
- **Spiral Geometry Mapping** – Data flows visualized through golden spiral radii.  
- **Codex Vault Archiving** – Mythic metadata, SHA-256 integrity, and timestamped storage.  
- **Encryption Simulation** – SHA-256 hashing with AES-CBC readiness.  
- **Real-Time Visualizations** – Scatter plots and histograms via Matplotlib.  
- **Modular Architecture** – Components for Scheduler, Transmitter, Vault, and Visualizer.  
- **Mythic Resonance** – Technical precision infused with ceremonial clarity.

## 📐 Mathematical Foundations
- **Fibonacci Sequence:** \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\)  
- **Golden Ratio:** \(\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618\)  
- **Golden Spiral Radius:** \(r(\theta) = ae^{b\theta}, \quad b = \frac{\ln \phi}{\pi/2}\)  
- **Tile Index Formula:** \(T_i = \lfloor \phi \cdot i \rfloor \mod N\)
